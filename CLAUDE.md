## Session: Dashboard Refactoring & Sidebar Implementation

### Task 1: Refactor Next.js Supabase Starter Kit into SaaS Dashboard

**Objective:** Transform the Next.js Supabase Starter Kit into a traditional dashboard layout (sidebar left, content right) with protected routes.

### Requirements Implemented:
1. ✅ Refactored main layout to be less opinionated
2. ✅ Created dashboard with sidebar navigation
3. ✅ Added navigation items: Dashboard, Mase Checker, Mase Generator, Settings, Billing
4. ✅ Renamed `/protected` route to `/dashboard`
5. ✅ Maintained existing authentication throughout
6. ✅ Created mock pages for all dashboard sections

### Task 2: Implement shadcn/ui Sidebar Component

**Objective:** Replace the custom sidebar with the professional shadcn/ui sidebar component for better UX and functionality.

### Requirements Implemented:
1. ✅ Installed shadcn/ui sidebar component with all dependencies
2. ✅ Created AppSidebar with proper structure and branding
3. ✅ Moved Settings and Billing to user dropdown menu
4. ✅ Implemented collapsible sidebar with mobile responsiveness
5. ✅ Added state persistence via cookies
6. ✅ Integrated user authentication and sign-out functionality

### Task 3: Implement shadcn/ui Authentication Pages

**Objective:** Replace basic auth pages with modern shadcn/ui login-03 component design featuring muted background and professional styling.

### Requirements Implemented:
1. ✅ Installed shadcn/ui login-03 component
2. ✅ Updated auth-pages layout with muted background and center alignment
3. ✅ Redesigned sign-in page with Card-based layout
4. ✅ Redesigned sign-up page with enhanced UX and success state
5. ✅ Redesigned forgot-password page with clear instructions
6. ✅ Updated SmtpMessage component to match new design
7. ✅ Preserved all existing authentication logic and actions

### Key Changes Made:

#### 1. Layout Restructuring
- **Main Layout (`app/layout.tsx`)**: Simplified to only provide theme and basic HTML structure
- **Public Layout (`app/(public)/layout.tsx`)**: Created for landing page and auth pages with nav/footer
- **Dashboard Layout (`app/dashboard/layout.tsx`)**: New layout with sidebar and header for authenticated users

#### 2. File Structure Changes
```
app/
├── (public)/
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── (auth-pages)/
│       ├── sign-in/
│       ├── sign-up/
│       └── forgot-password/
├── dashboard/
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── page.tsx
│   ├── mase-checker/page.tsx
│   ├── mase-generator/page.tsx
│   ├── settings/page.tsx
│   ├── billing/page.tsx
│   └── reset-password/page.tsx
```

#### 3. Components Created (Task 1)
- **DashboardSidebar** (`components/dashboard/sidebar.tsx`): Navigation sidebar with icons [DEPRECATED]
- **DashboardHeader** (`components/dashboard/header.tsx`): Header with user info and sign out [DEPRECATED]
- **Card Component** (`components/ui/card.tsx`): UI component for dashboard cards

#### 4. New Components (Task 2 - shadcn/ui Sidebar)
- **AppSidebar** (`components/app-sidebar.tsx`): Professional sidebar with shadcn/ui components
- **Sidebar Components** (`components/ui/sidebar.tsx`): Complete shadcn/ui sidebar system including:
  - SidebarProvider, Sidebar, SidebarHeader, SidebarFooter, SidebarContent
  - SidebarGroup, SidebarMenu, SidebarMenuItem, SidebarMenuButton
  - SidebarTrigger, useSidebar hook, and mobile responsiveness
- **Additional UI Components**: 
  - `components/ui/separator.tsx`
  - `components/ui/sheet.tsx` 
  - `components/ui/skeleton.tsx`
  - `components/ui/tooltip.tsx`

#### 5. Route Updates
All references to `/protected` were updated to `/dashboard`:
- `utils/supabase/middleware.ts`
- `app/auth/callback/route.ts`
- `app/actions.ts`

#### 6. Sidebar Implementation Details (Task 2)
- **App Name**: "Mase Docs" with "Document Generation" tagline in header
- **Main Navigation**: Dashboard, Mase Checker, Mase Generator (Settings & Billing moved to dropdown)
- **User Dropdown**: User email display, Billing, Settings, Theme, Sign Out
- **Mobile Responsive**: Uses offcanvas mode on mobile devices
- **State Persistence**: Sidebar open/closed state saved in `sidebar:state` cookie
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Cmd/Ctrl + B to toggle sidebar
- **Authentication Integration**: Fetches user data from Supabase and handles sign-out

#### 7. Authentication Pages Redesign (Task 3)
- **Layout**: Full-screen muted background (`bg-muted/50`) with centered content
- **Design System**: Card-based layout with consistent typography and spacing
- **Sign-In Page**: Professional welcome message with "Mase Docs" branding
- **Sign-Up Page**: Enhanced UX with success state handling and clear CTAs
- **Forgot Password**: Streamlined flow with helpful instructions
- **SmtpMessage**: Redesigned as Card component with better visual hierarchy
- **Responsive**: Optimized for all screen sizes with max-width constraints

### Issues Resolved:

#### Task 1 - Navigation Problem
**Issue:** After initial refactoring, dashboard sub-pages were not accessible.
**Cause:** Double authentication check in dashboard layout conflicting with middleware.
**Solution:** Removed redundant authentication redirect from dashboard layout, keeping only middleware protection.

#### Task 2 - Sidebar Visibility Issues
**Issue:** Sidebar was not displaying correctly, only showing trigger button.
**Cause:** Missing `useIsMobile` hook definition and conflicting CSS positioning.
**Solution:** 
- Added proper `useIsMobile` hook implementation
- Fixed CSS variables and state management
- Removed duplicate function definitions
- Updated dashboard layout to use `SidebarProvider` and `SidebarInset`

#### Task 3 - Password Reset Flow Security Issue
**Issue:** Users were automatically logged in when clicking reset password email links, instead of just being able to reset their password.
**Cause:** Standard auth callback was exchanging code for session automatically.
**Solution:**
- Created separate `/auth/reset-callback` route for password reset flow
- Created public `/reset-password` page that doesn't require authentication
- Modified forgot password action to use new callback
- After password reset, user is signed out and redirected to sign-in page
- Preserved dashboard reset password flow for already authenticated users

### Final Status:
✅ All dashboard pages are accessible and working
✅ Authentication flow maintained
✅ Professional shadcn/ui sidebar with full functionality
✅ Mobile responsive design with proper state management
✅ User dropdown with all account management options
✅ Clean, modern UI with proper theming
✅ No references to old `/protected` route remain
✅ Build process completes successfully without errors

### Development Commands:
```bash
npm run dev    # Start development server
npm run build  # Build for production
```

### Technical Notes:
- **Authentication**: Supabase handles user authentication and session management
- **Route Protection**: Middleware protects all `/dashboard/*` routes
- **Rendering**: All dashboard pages are server-side rendered
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components built on Tailwind CSS and Radix UI
- **State Management**: Sidebar state persisted via cookies for better UX
- **Responsive Design**: Automatic mobile detection with offcanvas behavior
- **Dependencies Added**: 
  - Task 2: `@radix-ui/react-dialog`, `@radix-ui/react-separator`, `@radix-ui/react-tooltip`
  - Task 3: `@radix-ui/react-label` (updated version)
  - Updated `@radix-ui/react-slot` and `class-variance-authority`

## Project Overview: MASE DOCS

### Business Context
MASE DOCS is a SaaS solution designed for professionals and companies who are or want to be MASE certified (Manuel d'Amélioration Sécurité des Entreprises) while staying focused on their core business and improving productivity.

### Core Modules

#### MASE CHECKER
An automated audit module that:
- Automatically audits HSE (Health, Safety, Environment) documentation using AI
- Detects regulatory gaps and non-conformities against the MASE framework
- Generates personalized audit reports

- Proposes prioritized action plans

#### MASE GENERATOR
A document generation module that:
- Automatically generates MASE-compliant documents (e.g., HSE policy, HSE action plans, management review, DUER templates, etc.)
- Works in two main contexts:
  1. **Post-audit**: After an automated audit (performed by MASE CHECKER), analyzing existing documents and generating/updating necessary ones
  2. **From scratch**: Generating all required documents from zero, with or without client data
